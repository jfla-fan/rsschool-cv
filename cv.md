### Goals

I have started coding at 17. At this age I began learning just for fun, but even then I knew that I will be a programmer. I enjoy getting new experience and exploring new technologies. I'm sure my intensions and aspirations to get under the hood all the stuff I see relating to computers will be paid off in the future.

Also I'm very interested in game dev. I think the first trigger that pushed me searching information about games was the FF7 Remake (Final Fantasy 7) released in 2020. I watched a lot of awesome and stunning effects that made me feel exciting and curious about how this all work at the same time. Since then I try to get as much as possible experience about games arrangements, game engines and use all the possibilities of getting knowledges.
