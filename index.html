                <div class="basic-info--content">
                    I have started coding at 17. At this age I began learning just for fun, but even then I knew that I will be a programmer. I enjoy getting new experience and exploring new technologies. I'm sure my intensions and aspirations to get under the hood all the stuff I see relating to computers will be paid off in the future.

Also I'm very interested in game dev. I think the first trigger that pushed me searching information about games was the FF7 Remake (Final Fantasy 7) released in 2020. I watched a lot of awesome and stunning effects that made me feel exciting and curious about how this all work at the same time. Since then I try to get as much as possible experience about games arrangements, game engines and use all the possibilities of getting knowledges.

I'm all in studying all the things accorded to computers.</div>
